## Hi there 👋

Cytometry In R Starter Questions

Location: Montreal, Qc, Canada

My Favorite Fluorophore/Metal-Isotope: All of them, obviously can't commit

Previous Coding Experience: The worst biostats course in undergrads, also copy pasting commands

What I Hope to Get From This Course: Help my trainees and feel somewhat less dumb when they ask me a question
